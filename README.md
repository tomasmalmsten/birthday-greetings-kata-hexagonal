# What's this?

This is a refactoring kata that can be used to teach Hexagonal Architecture. Or
just be used to learn refactoring.

The language ports provided have been made with some help from LLMs. They should be self-contained in terms of running and building.

If there is a language missing that you feel inclined to add, please do. I'd very much appreciate that.

It is a fork
from [this](https://github.com/ferdi145/birthday-greetings-kata-kotlin-hexagonal-workshop),
which in turn is a fork
from [this](https://github.com/xpmatteo/birthday-greetings-kata). Both with the
same intent but containing a few different variations, in language and code.
